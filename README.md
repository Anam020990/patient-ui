# Patient Health Records on Red Hat OpenShift
This project is a patient records user interface for a conceptual health records system. The UI is programmed with open standards JavaScript and modern, universal CSS, and HTML5 Canvas for layout.

The UI is served by a simple Node.JS Express server.

This project stands alone in test mode or integrates with another [associated project](https://github.com/ajp-io/patient-db-adapter).
